/**
 * @mainpage Cylinder Detection Node Documentation
 *
 * @section intro_sec Introduction
 *
 * This is the documentation for the `sprint_3` package, which includes a ROS 2 node 
 * designed for detecting cylindrical objects using LaserScan data.
 *
 * @section author_sec Author
 *
 * This package was developed by Jack Gruber.
 *
 * @section usage_sec Usage
 *
 * The main class is `CylinderDetectionNode`, which subscribes to LaserScan messages 
 * and processes the data to detect cylindrical objects.
 *
 * @section features_sec Features
 *
 * - Subscribes to LaserScan data.
 * - Converts polar coordinates to Cartesian coordinates.
 * - Clusters points to identify potential cylindrical objects.
 * - Checks for cylindrical shapes based on clustered points.
 * - Logs detected cylinders with their midpoints.
 *
 * @section installation_sec Installation
 *
 * To install and use the `sprint_3` package, follow these steps:
 * 1. Clone the package into your ROS 2 workspace.
 * 2. Build the workspace using `colcon build`.
 * 3. Source the workspace: `source install/setup.bash`.
 * 4. Run the node: `ros2 run sprint_3 cylinder_detection_node`.
 *
 * @section todo_sec TODO
 *
 * - Implement visualization of detected cylinders.
 * - Optimize clustering and cylindrical shape detection algorithms.
